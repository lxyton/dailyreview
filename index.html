            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born September 17th of 1999. My birth place was Clovis Community Hospital.
                I have a myriad of hobbies. Such as, playing xbox, going to the gym, social media, playing card games and sports with friends.
                I have a pretty big family on my Dad’s side and my Mom’s. Both sides are equally loving and supporting.
                I have many places in mind to visit.
                The first that comes to mind is traveling to Iceland for a week with friends and just exploring and camping.
                I would also love to visit Greece, France, Bora Bora, and China because the culture is never one to go wrong.
                China, ever since the new Karate Kid, with Jaden Smith, has always had my thoughts being evolved around it. As far as Greece,
                France, and Bora Bora, they just all have beautiful scenary and have gorgeous landmarks.
                </p>
            <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
                <h3>Long term goals</h3>
                    <p>My long term goal consists of supporting my family and being able to successfully change the world.
                        My family deserves the best from me, so that is what I am going to give them.
                        Supporting my family is a very important long term goal because they have supported me far more than I could ever
                        imagine and having them be comfortable and worry free is the only way I can picture them living.</p>
                    <p>Changing the world. I know this sounds like a crazy concept but our world has gotten out of hand and needs undoing.
                        Global warming, world hunger, and war are not what our planet should be used for and I wish to end these actions
                        and expand this ball of opportunity to its full potential. </p>
                <h3>Short term goals</h3>
                    <p>My short term goal is not too complex. It mainly consists of starting a business and expanding it, to its full potential.
                        While starting a business might be very challenging, I believe with hard work and dedication – such as any other idea –
                        can fulfill this goal of mine. After i achieve this goal, i will move on to opening new doors for my friends who might
                        not have been as lucky as i am. I know having great friends growing up is very important, so if my short goal is to be
                        accomplished, i would love nothing more than to help my friends that have supported me.</p>
            <h2 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h2>
                <h3>Educational</h3>
                    <p>I will always want the best education i can get. So, if that means having to save up money to get into a highly advanced
                    college, i will do so. My previous education has always been acceptionable. Meaning it's never been one to complain about. 
                    I've been to many different schools, so i always have to adapt to new teachings but in a way, that is beneficial for me, because
                    when college comes around i know that the teaching there will be far more complex than anything i have been taught. I remember in 8th
                    grade, i entered a math-lete and took 3rd place throughout 7 different schools.</p>
